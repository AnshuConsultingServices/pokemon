# AngularJS Pokemon Gallery application


## Overview

This application shows listing of Pokemon's


## Prerequisites


### Node.js and Tools

- Get [Node.js][node].
- Install the tool dependencies: `npm install`


## Workings of the Application

- The application filesystem layout structure is based on the [angular-seed][angular-seed] project.
- There is no dynamic backend (no application server) for this application. Instead we fake the
  application server by fetching Pokemon detail from the REST API of Pokemon


### Installing Dependencies

The application relies upon various Node.js tools, such as [Bower][bower]. You can install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also run Bower, which will download the Angular files needed for the current step of the
tutorial.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.

### Running the Application

- Run `npm start`.
- Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8001/](http://localhost:8001/) to see the application 
  running.
